# maze-rats-npc-gen

## Overview
A website to create NPC's for OSR RPG's using the Maze Rats system.

## Inspiration
Based heavily off of the Character Generator created by ScottMaclure (https://github.com/ScottMaclure/maze-rats-chargen).
Modeled off the RPG by Ben Milton called Maze Rats (https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats).

## Directions
When creating a new faction generate many NPCs and link them together through relationships.  You can also use this generator for PCs  All that needs it be added is attributes and Items specific to the system.  

## TODO
- Add more options for each value (currently only 24 possible choices for each value)
- Add relationships to the values
- Make a system to automatically link NPCs into groups/factions
- Have the system automatically recognise values which need more context (e.g. NPC goal "Craft item" needing to generate an item to craft)
